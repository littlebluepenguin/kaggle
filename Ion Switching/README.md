This is my work on [University of Liverpool - Ion Switching](https://www.kaggle.com/c/liverpool-ion-switching/) Kaggle competition. I worked on this a few months **after** the contest ended. The single LGBM model -- along with all the preprocessing -- shown here reaches the top 18 percentile in both the public and the private leaderboards. The wavenet reaches the top 15 percentile. In my [blog](https://littleblue.neocities.org/blog/IonSwitching.html) I detail my approach and explain all that I did.

Since github takes a lot of time to render Jupyter notebooks, I've created a [nbview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/littlebluepenguin/kaggle/Ion-Switching/tree/main/) where my work can be easily accessed.

I have to thank everyone, who through their work have made me a *slightly* better data scientist. I cannot possibly recall and thank all who have aided me -- the list is too long!! For those from whom I've either taken a lot of code(or inspiration) I put a them in [References](References.md) -- the others I thank wholeheartedly and implore to help me again in another contest. Thank you.
